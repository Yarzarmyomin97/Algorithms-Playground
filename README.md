These are my solutions to some of [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1524499146&sr=8-2&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interviews)'s problems. My goal is to work through them in a variety of programming languages, but for the moment I've mostly used Java (and a bit of Kotlin).
