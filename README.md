# Algorithms Playground

These are my solutions to some algorithmic problems taken from the following sources:

- [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.misc.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1524499146&sr=8-2&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interviews)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
- [MIT course 6006 - Introduction to algirhtms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/)
- Other sources ([Misc](https://github.com/husaynhakeem/Algorithms-Playground/tree/master/src/misc) folder)

My goal is to work through them in a variety of programming languages, but for the moment I've mostly used Java (and a bit of Kotlin).
