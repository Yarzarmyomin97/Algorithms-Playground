Delete middle node

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e, any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Example:
Input: The node c from the linked list a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
Result: Nothing is returned, but the new inked list looks like a -> b -> d -> e -> f
