N-Queens
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n=2 and n=3.

The expected output is an array of QueenSolution. QueenSolution is an array of QueenPositions that makes up a possible solution. QueenPositions is a class that holds the row and index that queen is placed in. This class can hold other methods.
