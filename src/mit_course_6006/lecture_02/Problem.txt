The document distance problem has applications in finding similar documents, detecting duplicates (Wikipedia mirrors and Google) and plagiarism, and also in web search (D2 = query).

Some Definitions:
• Word = sequence of alphanumeric characters
• Document = sequence of words (ignore space, punctuation, etc.)
