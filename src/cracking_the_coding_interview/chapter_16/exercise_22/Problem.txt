Langton's ant

An ant is sitting on an infinite grid of white and black squares. Initially, the grid is all white and the ant faces right. At each step, it does the following:
1. At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward one unit.
2. At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counter clockwise), and move forward one unit.

Write a program to simulate the first k moves that the ant makes and print the final board as a grid. Note that you are not provided with the data structure to represent the grid. This is something you design yourself. The only input to your method is k. You should print the final grid and return nothing. The method signature might be something like void printKMoves(int k).
